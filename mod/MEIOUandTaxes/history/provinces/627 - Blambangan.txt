#Province: Blambangan
#file name: 627 - Blambangan
# MEIOU-FB Indonesia mod
#Note: if MEIOU ever has a start date prior to 1293 then this province should be part of the
#Singhasari Empire.
#
#Future enhancement possibilities:
#-Make owner Balambangan (new country) from c1575 to MTR takeover
#-Make owner Balambangan after 1647
#-during some periods this Balambangan should be under Bali control
# Manpower Adjusted for DW5.2 by SirkTheMonkey's bot
