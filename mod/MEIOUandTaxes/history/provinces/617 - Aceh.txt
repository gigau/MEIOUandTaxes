#Before the Europeans arrived Indonesia was a region of city states. At times some cities
#grew more powerfull and dominated the region for a time but generally speaking prior to the Dutch
#this dominance was largely a matter of tribute and trade hegemony. This situation is not one that
#is easy to model in EU3. Moreover it is not sensible to create dozens of new countries in EU3
#to represent the city-states that only dominanted one EU3 province for 10 or 20 years (even if
#there were adequate historical records to do this accurately). Consequently in EU3 the history of
#Indonesia must be greatly simplified. In particular, "empires" are deemed to last until a new empire
#arises or the Europeans take over even if in reality the empire had declined and the province(s)
#had reverted to being a collection of city-states.
