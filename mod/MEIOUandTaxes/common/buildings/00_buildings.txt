#2011-aug-05 FB fine tuning/suggestions/annotations/questions
#		?are owner level benefits a good idea?
#		?why are all forts at fort_level = 1?
#		?are the owner level benefits a good idea?
#		(in large empires the cummulative effects of the owner benefits may be extreme)
#2011-aug-15 YF reworking the buildings
#		Standardising building base costs to 50/100/200/350/500/700 and const. times to 12/12/24/24/36/36
#		Sorry fuzzbug for jumping you in the plaza thread, effects are often too extreme or too weak
#		Rebalancing effects
#2011-sep-26 P  Reducing monthly incomes in favour of yearly incomes, to try and reduce AI inflation. Might also help lower tech rates.
#		Adding - spy defence to buildings that make it easier for people to move around
#		Adding + spy defence to buildings that keep track of peoples movements
#		Adding + revolt risk to high end military buildings
#2011-sep-28 P	Typo fixes
#		Removing defensivness from forts
#		Moving missionary chance from forts to welfare
#		Adding supply bonus to roads
#		Removing all tax modifiers and replacing with direct tax, still too much money in monthly and not enough in yearly incomes
#2011-oct-05 P 	Halving all production and trade modifiers
#		minor typo fixes
#		reduced merchants from buildings
#		nerfing welfare pop growth a little
#2012-feb-19 GG Adding my series of changes
